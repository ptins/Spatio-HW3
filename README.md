### Task 1
This exercise is to familiarize yourself with the ggmap library.
    1. Get the coordinates and the address of the Potawatomi zoo
    2. Plot a map with ggmap
    3. Compute the distance between the zoo and Oâ€™Hare airport, and report the time
    required to cover that distance driving, bicycling and walking. You will notice
    that, depending on the mode of transport, you will have different distances, why
    is it the case? Also, how are the estimated times computed?

### Task 2
As part of the homework, I have uploaded in sakai the measurements of precipitation
for February 2018 in mm, as reported in the NOAA National Centers for Environmental
Information (gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/maps/ncei). The data set is for the entire US, but we
consider only the midwest.
    1. Do a bubble plot of the data, comment on any trend that you see, as well as any
    particular feature of interest in the map.
    2. Do some exploratory analysis to check if the precipitation changing across longitude
    or latitude. If you see some trend, try to give a physical interpretation of it.
    3. Compute the classical and rubust variogram, comment on the general behavior of it.
